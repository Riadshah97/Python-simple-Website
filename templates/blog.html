              <p>Bangladesh, to the east of India on the Bay of Bengal, is a South Asian country marked by lush greenery and many waterways. 
                Its Padma (Ganges), Meghna and Jamuna rivers create fertile plains, and travel by boat is common. On the southern coast, the Sundarbans, 
                an enormous mangrove forest shared with Eastern India, is home to the royal Bengal tiger.Bangladesh forms the sovereign part of the historic and ethnolinguistic region of Bengal, which was divided during the Partition of British India in 1947.[18] The country has a Bengali Muslim majority; while neighboring Indian Bengali-speaking regions like West Bengal, Tripura and the Barak Valley have a Bengali Hindu majority. Ancient Bengal was an important cultural center in the Indian subcontinent as the home of the states of Vanga, Pundra, Gangaridai, Gauda, Samatata, and Harikela. The Mauryan, Gupta, Pala, Sena, Chandra and Deva dynasties were the last pre-Islamic rulers of Bengal. The Muslim conquest of Bengal began in 1204 when Bakhtiar Khalji overran northern Bengal and invaded Tibet. Becoming part of the Delhi Sultanate, three city-states emerged in the 14th century with much of eastern Bengal being ruled from Sonargaon. Sufi missionary leaders like Sultan Balkhi, Shah Jalal and Shah Makhdum Rupos helped in spreading Muslim rule. The region was unified into an independent, unitary Bengal Sultanate. At its peak, Bengal controlled neighboring Assam, Tripura, Arakan,[19] Bihar, Jaunpur and Orissa.[20][21][22] Bengali ships were among the largest ships on the trade routes of the Bay of Bengal, the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean, according to envoys from China and European travelers.[23] Under Mughal rule, eastern Bengal continued to prosper as the melting pot of Muslims in the eastern subcontinent and attracted traders from around the world.  </p>

                <p>The Bangladesh Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, founded in 1973, traces its roots to the East Pakistan Regional Laboratories established in Dhaka (1955), Rajshahi (1965) and Chittagong (1967). Bangladesh's space agency, SPARRSO, was founded in 1983 with assistance from the United States.[312] The country's first communications satellite, Bangabandhu-1, was launched from the United States in 2018.[313] The Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission operates a TRIGA research reactor at its atomic-energy facility in Savar.[314] In 2015, Bangladesh was ranked the 26th global IT outsourcing destination</p>

              <p>Stone Age tools found in Bangladesh indicate human habitation for over 20,000 years,[54][page needed] and remnants of Copper Age settlements date back 4,000 years.[54] Ancient Bengal was settled by Austroasiatics, Tibeto-Burmans, Dravidians and Indo-Aryans in consecutive waves of migration.[54][55] Archaeological evidence confirms that by the second millennium BCE, rice-cultivating communities inhabited the region. By the 11th century people lived in systemically-aligned housing, buried their dead, and manufactured copper ornaments and black and red pottery.[56] The Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna rivers were natural arteries for communication and transportation,[56] and estuaries on the Bay of Bengal permitted maritime trade. The early Iron Age saw the development of metal weaponry, coinage, agriculture and irrigation.[56] Major urban settlements formed during the late Iron Age, in the mid-first millennium BCE,[57] when the Northern Black Polished Ware culture developed.[58] In 1879, Alexander Cunningham identified Mahasthangarh as the capital of the Pundra Kingdom mentioned in the Rigveda.[59][60] The oldest inscription in Bangladesh was found in Mahasthangarh and dates from the 3rd century BCE. It is written in the Brahmi script.[61]

                Greek and Roman records of the ancient Gangaridai Kingdom, which (according to legend) deterred the invasion of Alexander the Great, are linked to the fort city in Wari-Bateshwar.[62][63] The site is also identified with the prosperous trading centre of Souanagoura listed on Ptolemy's world map.[64] Roman geographers noted a large seaport in southeastern Bengal, corresponding to the present-day Chittagong region.[65]</p>

              <p>The Bengali population was angered when Prime Minister-elect Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was prevented from taking the office.[131] Civil disobedience erupted across East Pakistan, with calls for independence.[132] Mujib addressed a pro-independence rally of nearly 2 million people in Dacca (as Dhaka used to be spelled in English) on 7 March 1971, where he said, "This time the struggle is for our freedom. This time the struggle is for our independence." The flag of Bangladesh was raised for the first time on 23 March, Pakistan's Republic Day.[133] Later, on 25 March late evening, the Pakistani military junta led by Yahya Khan launched a sustained military assault on East Pakistan under the code name of Operation Searchlight.[134][135] The Pakistan Army arrested Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and flew him to Karachi.[136][137][138] However, before his arrest Mujib proclaimed the Independence of Bangladesh at midnight on 26 March which led the Bangladesh Liberation War to break out within hours.</p>
